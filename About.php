                "What should I do next?" The question that all of us had at least one time.
                <br>
                This question started putting my wheels in motion. <br>
                The answer was simple: "I would like to learn something new!" . So I started a conversation with my girlfriend (now my lovely wife), she suggested unexpectedly to start a course of Computer Science. It was love at first word, so i started searching what should I learn, after some days of researching I decided to do BackEnd Development.
                <br>
                Long story short, here I am now, working on my first project!
